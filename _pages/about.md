## Education
* M.S. in ECE, UCSD - Sep 2017 ∼ Dec 2018(expected)
* B.S. in CS, National Taiwan University - Sep 2012 ∼ Jun 2016

## Experience
* Software Intern, TetraVue - Jul 2018 ∼ Sep 2018
  * Estimated translation and rotation between camera and IMU
  * Studied and developed visual inertial odometry using camera and IMU
* Research Assistant, National Taiwan University - Sep 2016 ∼ Aug 2017
  * Built  physical  therapy  assisting  functions  on  Nao  humanoid  robots  with  human  motion  imitation systems and balancing algorithms which are continuously used in the Lab
  * Developed C++ functions to keep biped robots’ centers of mass inside the supporting leg and to keep robots from falling while imitating humans doing Tai Chi
  * Determined  the  joint  angles  using  MATLAB  matrix  manipulation  functions  to  calculate  inverse kinematics from Kinect for Windows SDK 2.0 skeleton tracking data

## Projects
* Robotics operating system (ROS) - C++
  * Utilized ROS packages to detect markers’ pose and build a map with markers’ position and orientation
* Reinforcement learning - Python
  * Implemented advantage actor-critic (A2C) method in Pytorch and tested in OpenAI Gym Atari, Classic Control and Mujoco environments
  * Incorporated A2C with experience replay to increase the convergence speed
* Kaggle Humpback Whale Identification Challenge - Python
  * 135th of 494 (beating the benchmark)
  * Handled imbalance data (52% class contained only one image) by using resampling techniques and modifying the loss function
  * Implemented Siamese network in Keras to calculate image similarity for classification
* Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) - Python
  * Implemented a particle ﬁlter to track a humanoid robot’s 2D position and orientation using inertial measurement unit (IMU), odometry and laser measurements
  * Built 2D occupancy grid maps of the environment using the results of the particle ﬁlter
* Panorama - Python
  * Implemented an unscented Kalman ﬁlter (UKF) to estimate the 3D orientation of a rotating body using IMU reading
  * Generated panoramic images by stitching camera images based on the UKF estimation results
* 3D Point Cloud Object - C++
  * Utilized Point Cloud Library (PCL) Iterative Closest Point (ICP) functions to merge 3D data into one 3D stuffed toy model

## Skills
* Programming Languages: C/C++, Python, MATLAB
* Operating Systems: Linux (ubuntu), ROS, Windows
